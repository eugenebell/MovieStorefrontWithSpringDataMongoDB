<h1>Movie Storefront Project - Eugene Bell</h1>

<p><a href="movies/movieListing">To Begin Click Here!</a></p>
<p>Initially there is only the admin user (admin/admin) and a normal user (keri/keri). When you login as admin you well see 2 menu options.
The first one allows you to create normal users i.e. ROLE_USER. These users can login through the same login
and are directed to the user space. The admin users can also view the list of users and select there name to see what movies
they have reserved and can set them to have been rented which will charge there account at the price 
as per movie metadata (There is no way for the user to reset their total in this demo). The admin user can also delete the users.
</p>
<p>As a normal user when you log in you are redirected to the storefront where a menu that has 11 Movie Genres is displayed and all the movies for
the initial genre are shown. The user can select the 
movie link (the Title of the movie) to see the Movie details and select the reserve button to reserve this movie 
(user can also undo reservation).
